Conditional Force License

If the force be with you; you accept this work under the MIT license:
else if you are a 'for-profit' entity you are conditionally licensed to use this work on the basis of goodwill, but said license is immediately revoked under conditions of corrupted principles or efforts to dominate and control the project concepts to serve the 'profit' motive:
else you are not welcome here.

Forks and Feedback on Conditional Force License welcome. (I'm concerned the MIT license leaves the project vulnerable to corrupt political insiders and entrenched government interest.)
